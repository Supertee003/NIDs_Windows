# 10 - Current Phase

## Status: Kernel NIDS Consolidation and Evidence Closure

G1-G21 rewrite complete. G22 final polish complete. G23 consolidation is being
closed against the current Kernel NIDS source and live evidence. The production
product is detection-only; enforcement activation is permanently out of scope.

Provider readiness, WFP transport, and retained PEP boundaries may exist for
diagnostics, fail-closed behavior, or historical/lab evidence, but they do not
authorize a production host effect.

## Current-Head Evidence Update — 2026-10-31

- `IDS-HOST-004` is implemented at source commit `940a6f8` (E2): ETW/FIM/Registry
  detector identities may flow to forensic evidence/IDS receipts, but host
  telemetry cannot enter threat scoring or policy/PEP/ActionDispatcher.
- `zig build` and `zig build test` passed; the focused detection-authority and
  prevention-gate pytest contracts passed 20/20. Truth artifacts verify cleanly.
- This is source/build and unit/component evidence only. It is not Windows-host
  E5 proof, full ADR-0009 closure, kernel-driver production qualification, or
  release approval. See `admin-evidence/ids-host-004-20261031/closeout.md`.

## G23 Goals

1. Create canonical architecture documentation
2. Create FILE_REGISTRY.csv
3. Create AI context files (this directory)
4. Create cross-language CI matrix
5. Fix compliance wording
6. Create build manifest template
7. Create deprecation map
8. Remove tracked backup/build files (P0 cleanup)

## Completion Criterion

AEGIS is ready to leave consolidation when:

```
ONE EVENT
  -> ONE CANONICAL MODEL
  -> ONE RUNTIME SPINE
  -> ONE STATE AUTHORITY
  -> ONE EVIDENCE MODEL
  -> ONE DECISION AUTHORITY
  -> ONE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY
  -> ONE FORENSIC TRACE
  -> ONE REPLAY PATH
```

And CI proves: C/C++ + Zig + Go + Rust + Python/Cython + Drivers as one product.

## Remaining closure work

1. Complete `MAP-006`: reconcile runtime manifest, flow map, authority map, and
   evidence index against actual current code/runtime wiring.
2. Produce supervised Windows-host evidence for applicable host telemetry and
   sensor paths; do not infer E5 from unit tests or a successful build.
3. Classify older IPS/WFP material as historical or lab-only without deleting
   it, and keep production host-effect capability false.
4. Complete supervised RB-017 Brain evidence without starting a second listener
   or changing the production detection-only gate.

Do not introduce an IPS activation phase into the production roadmap.

## Team Command

> Do not make the repository larger until you know which files are authoritative.

> Do not make a Phase "done" because the code compiles.

> Do not let AI infer architecture from source alone.

> Give AI the semantic position, ownership, contract, boundaries, allowed files and exit gate before it edits code.

> Every removed legacy path is progress. Every duplicate authority is technical debt.
